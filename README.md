Rows of Victory is a simple yet powerful tools for entertainment and cognitive development inspired by Tic-Tac-Toe.

Designed for both learning and entertainment, the game encourages players to think ahead, recognize patterns, and develop strategies—making it both enjoyable and mentally stimulating.

Rows of Victory features two exciting game modes: Player vs Player and Player vs Computer. If you choose to play against the computer, you’ll also be able to select a difficulty level—Easy, Medium, or Hard—depending on how challenging you want the game to be. The game uses a unique move algorithm where your first move disappears after your fourth, encouraging pattern recognition and strategic thinking. I developed this project using Java during my first year, second semester, as a requirement for our subject Computer Programming 2.
